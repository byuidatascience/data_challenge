## Reducing Gun Deaths (FiveThirtyEight)

### Background

The world is a dangerous place. During 2015 and 2016 there was a lot of discussion in the [news about police shootings](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/controversial-police-shootings/). [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) reported on [gun deaths in 2016](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/). As leaders in data journalism, they have posted a clean version of this data in their GitHub repo called [full_data.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data) for us to use.

While their visualizations focused on yearly averages, your client wants to create commercials that help reduce the gun deaths in the US. They would like to target the commercials in different seasons of the year (think month variable) to audiences that could have the most impact in reducing gun deaths. 

### Key Details

- Please use your preferred programming language to address the following items.
- Please use the Github template repository to create a private repository where you complete your work.
- Add the following Github usernames to your repo with read access - `hathawayj`, `sburton42`, `dkpalmers`, `AHFXAdam`, `ComeauBYUI`, `katie-allen`
- Note that we are using this challenge to see your coding, data, and communication skills. Please make sure your work exemplifies your data science acumen.
- We don’t want this challenge to take longer than a few hours. Please state how many hours you spent on the project in your markdown file.

### Tasks

1. Create one plot that provides similar insight to the [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/) visualization in the article. It does not have to look like theirs.

2. Address the client’s need for emphasis areas of their commercials for different seasons of the year. Please write a short paragraph describing your chart, table, or analysis result that helps your client know the potential groups (variables) where they could market in different seasons.

3. Compile a .md file into your git repository that puts all of your work together in one document.

4. Include your `.R`, `.py`, `.Rmd`, or `.quarto` script that contains your analysis code with comments.
